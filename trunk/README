     Installation Problems
--------------------------------     
1.  Error 2869 when installing on Microsoft Vista
	When you install GeoPhyloBuilderon Windows Vista, you receive an error message: "The installer has encountered an unexpected error installing this package. This may indicate a problem with this package. The error code is 2869"
This happens because of User Access Control (UAC) feature of Windows Vista. UAC is incompatible with some features used with windows installation packages (.msi files).
I have not tested out these possible solutions yet as I do not have access to Vista at the moment. Please email me and tell me if you try it and it works.

    * Solution 1 
   1). Disable UAC. You can do this in various ways, either with MSCONFIG, using Regedit, using Group Policy or using the Control Panel.
   2). Start a command prompt and change to the directory containing the GeoPhyloBuilder setup file. Then run "msiexec /i GeoPhyloBuilder.msi".
   3). Create a batch file (e.g. intravnews.bat) containing the line "GeoPhyloBuilder.msi". Place this batch file in the same folder as the GeoPhyloBuilder.msi file. Now start a command prompt with Administrative privileges: Start, Run, CMD, then press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. Now type "GeoPhyloBuilder.bat" and press Enter. 

    * Solution 2. Temporarily turning off the User Account Control (UAC) will allow you to install successfully. 
   1). Go to Start and choose Control Panel.
   2). Select User Account and Family settings and choose "Add or Remove User Account".
   3). Select on one of the user accounts, you can use yours or the guest account.
   4). Under the user account click "Go to the main User Account page" link.
   5). Under "Make changes to your user account" click "Change security settings".
   6). In the "Turn on User Account Control (UAC) to make your computer more secure", click to unselect "Use User Account Control (UAC) to help protect your computer". Choose Ok.
   7). You will be prompted to reboot your computer. Do so when ready. 

If you have trouble finding the User Account Control selection, the Control Panel has a search option towards the top right side. Search for "UAC" and the option for “Turn User Account Control (UAC) on or off" will display. Don't forget to re-enable UAC after install for security reasons. In order to re-enable UAC just select the above checkbox and reboot.

2. Error: 99 External component has thrown an exception when pressing Open button for the Spatial Class

    * This is a bug of ArcGIS. The workaround is to rename the fmearcgisext.dll file.
    * Find the fmearcgisext.dll file. The default location of the file is: C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Data Interoperability Extension. If the file is not located there, you will have to find it.
    * Rename the file fmearcgisext.dll to OLDfmearcgisext.dll. Do Not Delete It!
    * Restart GeoPhyloBuilder and it should work. 

3. Error message: unable to get installer types in the geophylobuilder_1-0.exe assembly. unable to load one or more of the requested types. retrieve the loaderExceptions property for more informations

	1). Verify that Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 is installed.

    * Click the “Start” button and select “Control Panel.”
    * Double-click on “Add or Remove Programs.”
    * If “Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0” is already installed on your computer, skip to step 3 below.
    * If you do not see “Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0” in the list of programs, proceed to step 2 below. 

	2). Go to the Microsoft web site.

    * Browse to the downloads page, and download “Microsoft .NET Framework Version 2.0 Redistributable Package (x86).”
    * Install .NET 2.0 on your machine.
    * Proceed to step 3 below. 

	3). Verify that Microsoft Framework .NET 1.1 is installed.

    * Open the Control Panel.
    * Double-click on “Add or Remove Programs.”
    * If “Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1” is already installed on your computer, skip to step 5 below.
    * If you do not see “Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1” in the list of programs, proceed to step 4 below. 

	4). Go to the Microsoft web site.

    * Browse to the downloads page, and download “Microsoft .NET Framework Version 1.1 Redistributable Package.”
    * Install .NET 1.1 on your machine. 

	5). Check to see if ArcGIS ArcObjects.NET API is installed.

    * Open the Control Panel.
    * Open the Add/Remove Programs Admin.
    * Select the "ArcGIS Desktop" program entry. Click "Change."
    * Locate the ArcGIS Desktop setup disc (this may not be necessary if the disk is already in the CD drive or if you installed from a network location).
    * Select the "Modify" option in the application maintenance screen. Click "Next."
    * In the "Features to install" tree, look under the "Application" node. There should be a sub-node labeled: ".NET Support". If there IS a red X icon next to it, then the ArcObjects.NET API has not been installed. In this case, go to step 6. If there IS NOT a red X, then the ArcObjects.NET API has already been installed. 

	6). Add the ArcObjects.NET API feature to ArcGIS.

    * Click the drop-down icon next to the ".NET Support" feature. Select the "Will be installed on the local hard drive" option.
    * Click "Next."
    * Click "Next" on the "Ready to Modify Application" page.
    * Click "Finish" on the "Successfully installed" page.
